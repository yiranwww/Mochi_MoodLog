# Mochi_MoodLog

## Env Requirement
 1. streamlit (pip install streamlit)
 2. Python version is between 3.9 to 3.13
 3. A public or private Google Sheet.
    In this project I have provided the Google sheet link in "Mochi.py" where everyone could have access. The link will be modified and close after the process is over.

## Running Instructions
Run "streamlit run Mochi.py" in the terminal, and you will see the Streamlit app in the browser.
Click for the mood option, and leaving a note is optional.

After submitting the mood and the notes, the user will see the bar chart for today's mood.


## Results store
The users' feedback are stored in the Google sheet with format $[timestamp, mood, note]$, so make sure the good sheet alread has the three head.
